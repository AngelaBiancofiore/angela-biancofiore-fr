When humans separated animate matter from the inanimate (see Descartes’ philosophy on this subject), they separated themselves from the web of life and started to see the Earth as a stock of raw mate-rials that could be used at will. However, if we relocate humans in the context of ecosystems, this new in-sight allows us to concretely move the boundaries of concern. In other terms, there is an ecology of ideas as well as there is an ecology of ecosystems, an inner ecology that is no less important than outer ecolo-gy, because the influence of ideas, feelings and emotions is tangible in the process of transformation of the planet: the disenchantment of nature initiated by Descartes drove the legitimization of the structural vio-lence of our relationships with the living. Finally, we need to make peace with the Earth, recognizing the sig-nificant role played by all beings in the web of life; however, to restore a peaceful relation with the Earth means making peace with ourselves and with others, taking care of our own emotions, thoughts and feel-ings.
